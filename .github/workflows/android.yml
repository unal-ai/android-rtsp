    # Since the project is missing the wrapper jar, we rely on the setup-java or gradle-build-action
    # to provide a gradle environment, OR we regenerat the wrapper.
    # But usually 'setup-java' caches gradle but doesn't install the gradle binary if wrapper is used.
    # Let's use the 'gradle-build-action' which handles wrapper Validation and distribution.
    # If the wrapper is broken/missing, we might need to use 'gradle' command directly or fix wrapper.
    # Let's try running with the repo's wrapper first, assuming the user might fix it or we rely on 'gradle' if wrapper fails.
    # Actually, because we know wrapper jar is missing, let's try to install a specific gradle version or use 'gradle'
    # command from the runner if available.
    # However, standard practice is to use wrapper.
    # For now, let's try to regenerate wrapper or use the installed gradle.
    # Ubuntu runners normally have gradle installed.
